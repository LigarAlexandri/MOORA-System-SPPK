# MOORA System - Multi-Objective Optimization for Decision Making

---

## üöÄ Overview

The **MOORA System** is a robust and intuitive application designed to simplify complex decision-making processes using the **Multi-Objective Optimization by Ratio Analysis (MOORA)** method. This system helps users evaluate and rank alternatives based on multiple, potentially conflicting, criteria to arrive at an optimal solution.

Whether you're choosing a vendor, selecting a project, or making any decision requiring a structured approach with various factors, the MOORA System provides a transparent and data-driven way to achieve clarity.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Multi-Criteria Evaluation:** Seamlessly handles multiple quantitative and qualitative criteria.
* **Weighted Criteria:** Allows users to assign different importance (weights) to each criterion.
* **Benefit & Cost Criteria:** Distinguishes between criteria that are beneficial (higher is better) and those that are costly (lower is better).
* **Automated MOORA Calculation:** Performs all necessary normalization and ratio analysis calculations.
* **Clear Ranking:** Generates a definitive ranking of alternatives from best to worst based on the MOORA score.
* **[Add any other specific features, e.g., "User-friendly interface", "Data import/export options", "Visualization of results", "Support for CSV input", etc.]**

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (The MOORA Method)

The MOORA method is a powerful technique for multi-objective optimization. Here's a simplified breakdown of the steps the system automates:

1.  **Normalization:** Converts raw performance values of alternatives into a common, dimensionless scale.
2.  **Weighted Sum:** Multiplies the normalized performance by the assigned weights for each criterion.
3.  **Ratio Analysis:** Calculates a net score for each alternative by summing the weighted normalized values of beneficial criteria and subtracting the weighted normalized values of non-beneficial (cost) criteria.
4.  **Ranking:** Alternatives are ranked based on their final MOORA score, with higher scores indicating better performance.
